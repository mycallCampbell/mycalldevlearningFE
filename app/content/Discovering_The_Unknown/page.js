            Is there an abundance of untapped knowledge that surrounds us? And if so, is there a structured way to seek out this knowledge?

        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
            From an early age I have been fascinated with discoveries and spotting 
            anomalies in our everyday lives that rest before us, hidden from our awareness. 
            I believe there is a cognitive funnel to assist in such discoveries.

        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
            Each being has their own circle of awareness and knowledge that we utilise in our everyday lives. 
            From birth we have taken this awareness and converted it into a knowing or 
            understanding to get through life.
        </div>

        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
           This is Tier 1: The state of being aware of something 
           (electricity) and knowing or understanding how to use it.
        </div>

        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
            E.g. You our aware of the existence of electricity, and moreover hold the expertise knowledge in electricity to rewire a circuit. 
        </div>

        <div className={styles.contentMain}> 
            Imagine our awareness, and understanding of knowledge, as a circle 
            (Infograpic above).... The more we are aware of and know or understand, the larger our circle! 
        </div>

        <div className={styles.headerSub}>
            2. What We are Aware of and are yet to Know....
        </div>

        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
        Additionally, there are things in life we are aware of and do not understand or have the knowledge to utilise. 
        </div>

        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
            This is tier 2: the state of being aware of something (electricity) and 
            not knowing or understanding how to use it. 
        </div>

        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
        E.g. We are aware of the existence of electricity, although we are not a skilled electrician and would not be able to rewire a circuit.
        </div>
        
        <div className={styles.containerImageFullWidth}>
          <Image

        </div>
    
        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
            Now imagine this scenario of awareness and not knowing as a circle. 
            This circle of awareness and NOT knowing is much, much larger compared to the circle of awareness and knowing as described in Tier 1. 
            There is so much that exists that we are aware of and that we do not understand or have the knowledge to utilise. 
       </div>
        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
            We are continuously reaching out into the circle of &apos;awareness and not knowing&apos; 
            to educate, grow and evolve as a person. Everytime we learn and convert a discipline 
            of not knowing into a knowing, we make our &apos;circle of awareness and knowledge&apos; larger. 
            Thereby, forever adding to our foundation of knowledge! 
        </div>

        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
            The more time we spend in Tier 2:

        </div>
        
        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
            the more we grow intellectually and as a person. Tier 2 can be considered an uncomfortable placement 
            as we are always being faced with new challanges that our minds have yet to overcome. And therefore, some individuals will only spend time in 
            Tier 2 until they have acquired enough knowledge to afford them the ability to pop back over into Tier 1 and become a practitioner of what they know. 
            Tier 1 is certainly a more comfortable place to be, cognitively speaking.   
        </div>

        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
            Having said that, Tier 2 and its inherent uncomfortable nature wields power. I will explain the reasons why in my conclusion.... 
        </div>


        <div className={styles.headerSub}>
            3. What We are unawre of and therefore do not know....
        </div>

        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
            It goes without saying, if you have no awareness of something then you are unware and not knowing. 
            To help explain this scenario, try to think of or imagine a new colour. 
        </div>

        <div className={styles.containerImageFullWidth}>
          <Image 
              src={"/content/Discovering_The_Unknown/Rainbow.jpg"}

              alt='image hero' 
              quality={100}
          />
        </div>

        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
            Your mind wonders into the unknown and returns with nothing. 
            This is because you have no awareness of such a colour.  
        </div>

        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
            This is tier 3: the state of being unaware of something and therefore are without any form of 
            knowing or understanding. 
        </div>

        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
            E.g. lets stick with the electricity theme.... Postulate that there is more to the 
            existence of electricity than we are currently aware of. This may well be true.... although, 
            how can we arrive at such discoveries?
        </div>

        <div className={styles.containerImageFullWidth}>
          <Image 
              src={"/content/Discovering_The_Unknown/Electricity_Power.jpg"} 
              width={1456} 
              height={816}
              className={styles.image}
              alt='image hero' 
              quality={100}
          />
        </div>

        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
            Before I get into that, for the final time, imagine Tier 3 as a circle of unawareness. 
            I propose that it's size is colosall with an infinite reach waiting to be tapped into. 
        </div>

        <div className={styles.headerSub}>
            How:
        </div>

        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
            Most, if not all, discoveries are born out of challanging the mind. If you are that electrician, 
            then you will be continuously working away at new experiments and testing theories. 
            Pushing the envelope on all and everything that springs to mind. 
        </div>

        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
            Remember earlier I mentioned that Tier 2 wields power. Well.... 
            If you continue to spend time in Tier 2 (that seemingly uncomfortable place), 
            your inquisitive nature will engage thought provocations to initiate the 
            discovery of the unaware and unknown into the aware. 
        </div>

        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
            Immediately thereafter, Tier 2's circle
            is populated as a direct consequence of your discovery. You now become aware of something you were previously unaware of. 
        </div>
        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
            By virtue, Tier 3's circle is empty in our minds for 99.99% recurring. 
            The moment the unaware becomes aware, 
            it falls directly into Tier 2's circle.
        </div>

        <div className={styles.contentMainThick}>
           The Funnel of Knowledge....
        </div>

        <div className={styles.containerImageFullWidth}>
          <Image 
              src={"/content/Discovering_The_Unknown/Funnel_Of_Knowledge.jpg"} 
              width={1456} 
              height={816}
              className={styles.image}
              alt='image hero' 
              quality={100}
          />
        </div>

        <div className={styles.headerSub}>
            Conclusion: 
        </div>

        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
            To grow, develop and evolve we should spend a shared amount of time between Tier 1 and Teir 2.
            Spending time in Tier 1 is important for the practition and growth of what we know. 
            If we don't use it we'll lose it!
        </div>

        <div className={styles.contentMain}>
            Spending time in Tier 2 has a dual purpose (depending on how far you push the envelope). 
            You are continuously populating Tier 1 with your newly acquired knowledge and moreover, 
            tapping into Tier 3 for those discoveries.
